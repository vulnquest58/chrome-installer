## 🌟 Overview

The **Google Chrome Installer Script** is a lightweight, Bash-based automation tool that simplifies the process of installing Google Chrome on Ubuntu-based systems. It eliminates manual intervention by automating all required steps, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

---

## 🔧 Features

- **Fully Automated**: No manual steps required—just run the script and let it handle everything.
- **Background Execution**: All operations are performed in the background to maintain a clean terminal interface.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides clear success or failure messages at each stage of the installation process.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the script to install beta or unstable versions of Google Chrome.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling to ensure the script exits gracefully in case of failure.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following:

1. **Operating System**: A Linux distribution based on Ubuntu (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Pop!_OS, etc.).
2. **Internet Connectivity**: Required to download packages and keys.
3. **Sudo Privileges**: Necessary for installing software and modifying system files.
4. **Terminal Access**: Basic familiarity with the Linux terminal.

---

## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Script
Save the script (`install_chrome.sh`) to your system. You can clone this repository or download the script directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vulnquest58/chrome-installer.git
cd chrome-installer
```

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

Once you have downloaded or cloned the script, you need to grant it execution permissions. This ensures that the script can be run as a program. Use the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install_chrome.sh
```

This command modifies the file's permissions, allowing it to be executed.

---

### Step 3: Run the Script

After making the script executable, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
./install_chrome.sh
```

The script will execute in the background, performing all necessary steps to install Google Chrome. You will see real-time feedback messages indicating the progress of each operation.

---
### Step 4: Follow the Prompts

The script is designed to guide you through the installation process. It will display clear and concise messages for each step, such as:

- **Success Messages** : `[✔] Operation completed successfully.`
- **Failure Messages** : `[❌] Operation failed. Exiting...`

If the installation is successful, you will see a confirmation message like this:


```bash

[🎉] Google Chrome has been successfully installed!

You can launch it by typing 'google-chrome' in the terminal or from the application menu.

```
In case of failure, the script will exit gracefully and provide guidance on the issue.

---
## 🌟 Script Workflow

The script automates the entire installation process by performing the following tasks:

1. **System Update** :
    
    - Updates the package list and upgrades existing packages to ensure compatibility.
    - Runs in the background to avoid cluttering the terminal.
2. **Add Signing Key** :
    
    - Downloads and imports Google's official signing key to verify the authenticity of the Chrome package.
3. **Add Repository** :
    
    - Adds the official Google Chrome repository to your system's package manager.
4. **Install Chrome** :
    
    - Installs the stable version of Google Chrome (`google-chrome-stable`) silently in the background.
5. **Verify Installation** :
    
    - Checks if Google Chrome was installed successfully and provides feedback to the user.

Each step is executed sequentially, with error handling to ensure the script exits safely if any operation fails.
